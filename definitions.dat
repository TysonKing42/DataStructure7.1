ArrayArrayLinearûAn array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, like a list. Each element in an array is identified by its unique index or position in the collection. This makes it easy to access and manipulate individual elements within the array.Binary Search TreeTree
Non-Linear¤A binary search tree is a binary tree where each node has at most two child nodes, and the left subtree of a node contains only values less than or equal to the node's value, while the right subtree contains values greater than the node's value. This structure allows for efficient searching.GraphGraphs
Non-LinearÄA graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can represent complex relationships between elements, and they come in various forms, such as directed and undirected graphs.
Hash TableHash
Non-Linear§A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values. It provides efficient access to data by allowing quick retrieval based on key values.HeapTree
Non-LinearÅA heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It's often used to implement priority queues and efficiently find the maximum or minimum element in a collection.Linked listListLinearâA linked list is another way to organize and store data. In a linked list, elements are stored as nodes, and each node has a reference to the next node in the list. This structure allows for efficient insertions and deletions.ListListLinearÆA list is a flexible data structure that can change in size as you add or remove elements. Unlike arrays, lists don't have a fixed size, making them more versatile for managing collections of items.QueueAbstractLinearøA queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the back, or "enqueue," and removed from the front, or "dequeue," making it suitable for tasks like task scheduling and order processing.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-LinearÍA self-balancing tree is a type of binary tree that automatically reorganizes its nodes to maintain balance, ensuring that the tree remains efficient for operations like searching, insertion, and deletion.SetAbstract
Non-Linear½A set is a data structure that stores a collection of unique elements. It's useful for tasks that involve eliminating duplicate values or checking for membership in a distinct set of items.StackAbstractLinearäA stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack, making it useful for tasks like managing function calls or tracking state changes.Two Dimension ArrayArrayLinearÇA two-dimensional array is like a regular array, but it's organized in rows and columns. It's used to store data in a grid-like format, which is handy for representing things like matrices or tables.
